# Distributed Algorithms
This repository contains the two courseworks that were made by Aditya Rajagopal and I for the Distributed Algorithms course that we took in our 3rd year at Imperial College London.
The specification as well as all the code that we submitted can be found in these repositories.
There are instructions on how to run the entire system and a brief description of functionality within each project folder.
